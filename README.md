# Pedal Des Moines

Recent observations of the robustness of New York City's Citibank-sponsored bike share program, Citibike, have led to increased interest in deploying similar programs. Already, several other major cities, such as Chicago, Atlanta, and Austin, have seen the successful deployment of various bike share models.

The question is: can the success of such a system be reasonably guaranteed in Des Moines?

We think so becase Des Moines is Des Best!

## The Analysis
Deciding on whether a transportation model can be plucked from one metropolitan area and **successfully** implemented elsewhere requires taking in and processing data pertaining to many key factors including population demographics, density, industry, and weather. This first phase of the analysis focuses primarily on age and income demographics.
